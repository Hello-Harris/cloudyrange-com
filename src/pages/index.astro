				Weclcome to Cloudy Range! This site was developed to serve as a technical resource through the journey of building high-performance, but "lab-able" environments to improve technical skils required for day-to-day operations or certification tests.

				Whether you are finishing up a deployment at work, studying for your next certification or optimizing your home data center, you can expect deep dives and insights across Automation, Cloud, Networking, and Virtualization. Join me as I explore the front lines of IT, bridging the gap between on-prem infrastrucure and physical hardware and the virtual world.
